        w W	word, WORD

        b B	back-word, WORD

        e E	end-of-word, WORD

        ( )	sentence

        { }	paragraph

	You can move faster by visiting each word,
	rather than each letter! The distinction
	between "word" and "WORD" is helpful when
	there are special characters. Like in a URL:
	http://www.fullbeaker.com/w/xyz for example.
